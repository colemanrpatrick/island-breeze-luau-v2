          <p><span>T</span>he ancient heiau temple is the last residence of Kamehameha the Great. Kamakahonu was the first capital of Hawai'i as Kamehameha the Great established residency here in 1812, entertaining visitors and conducting affairs for a newly unified kingdom.</p>
          <p><span>K</span>amakahonu, the historic site of the Island Breeze Lü'au, is unique to all of Hawai'i. Here Kamehameha the Great, Hawai'i's king who conquered all the Hawaiian Islands in the early 1800s, made his home and ruled the Islands. Home to Hawaiian Ali' i (rulers), Kamakahonu was kapu (forbidden) to the average Hawaiian.</p>
          <p><span>K</span>ing Kamehameha worshiped his gods and sought the advice of his generals and advisors at the Ahu'ena Heiau (the temple adjacent to the lū'au grounds) and now restored. Upon Kamehameha's death in 1819, his body was prepared for burial at a stone platform near the lū'au stage; the location of his burial site is one of the great mysteries of Hawai'i.</p>
          <p><span>I</span>n November of 1819, Kamehameha's wives, Ka'ahumanu and Keōpūolani, publicly ate with his heir, Liholiho, breaking the ancient Hawaiian kapu system (that men & women must eat separately), Kamehameha's high priest, Hewahewa, led in the destruction of na ki'i (idols at Ahu'ena). This began the dissolution of the native Hawaiian religion. His priest also predicted that a new religion would arrive in Kailua-Kona.</p>
          <p><span>I</span>n the spring of 1820, the first missionary party from New England arrived in Kailua-Kona aboard the brig Thaddeus. They stepped ashore at the south end of Kamakahonu Bay on to a rock that for decades was known as the Plymouth Rock of Hawai'i.</p>
          <p><span>W</span>ithin the lobby of the Courtyard Marriott King Kamehameha's Kona Beach Hotel are displays, paintings and artifacts that tell the story of the Hawaiian ruler's life and times.</span> </p>

			<p><span>T</span>he Court Conch Herald and Court Chanter ushers in our Royal Court, representing the personages of King Kamehameha I and his retainers. During this procession you will hear a short narrative history of King Kamehameha I and his Royal Court.</p>
			<p><span>T</span>he royal personages were ranked from the very highest Kapu chiefs down to those of minor importance. There are Hawaiian names for various classes and ranks of rulers, but early visitors knew them by their English titles, "Chief" and "Chiefess." The Kamehameha and Kalakaua dynasties favored British court customs and used the titles. Hawaiian royalty by origin were from the same class of people as the working classes.</p>
			<p><span>L</span>eadership gradually became the privilege of the strongest and the most intelligent. These leaders enjoyed the best food, frequent massage by experts, were excellent in the performing arts, traditions, sports and warfare. They came to believe that they were of divine origin and prepared genealogical chants, which traced their ancestry to the gods.</p>
